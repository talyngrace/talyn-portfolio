# talyn-portfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio for the work I will create in the future for my future employers to look at. I followed a demo for the general formatting while creating this page. I created this project to use as a base for creating more. I learned while making this page how to use flexbox more!

## Installation
This page uses HTML and a CSS page. 

## Usage
The site consists of a header with a navigation bar that when the links are pressed, scrolls to the correct place on the page. In the main body there is an "About Me" section that has a breif bio, a Work section that showcases 5 large boxes that lead to the work I will create, and finally a contact section with my contact info.
